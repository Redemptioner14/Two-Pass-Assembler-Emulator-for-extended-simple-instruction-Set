This txt file, claims.txt, is part of the assignment of CS321 - CS322 at the 
department of Computer Science and Engg, IIT Patna . 
*****************************************************************************/

Files:
==========
*All the files i submitted, emu.cpp and claims.txt, have my name and student id at the start, along with a declaration of 
authorship.

* Files included are trace output for some test samples, emu.cpp, emu(executable)

Compilation instructions:
=========================
	
	g++ emu.cpp -o emu
	./emu -[commands] filename.o

	Commands are 
	-trace  show instruction trace
	-read   show memory reads
	-write  show memory writes
	-before show memory dump before execution
	-after  show memory dump after execution
	-wipe   wipe written flags before execution
	-isa    display ISA

Assumptions:
============
    * Mnemonic named “data” is always used at the end of assembly code.
    * In trace, printed register values(or SP or PC) are values after execution of the current line

NOTE:
=====
	* Every claim about assembler is already submitted and it satisfies here too (for emulator)
	* all the commands work as mentioned above.

The emulator: 
=============
(some files which were tested)
1. test4.o
	compiles successfully with all functionalities working as mentioned above

2. custom1.o
	compiles successfully with all functionalities working as mentioned above

Can detect errors (if infinite loop or out of bound access)
	*reports it as segmentation fault.

all other files are supposed to work fine too.
